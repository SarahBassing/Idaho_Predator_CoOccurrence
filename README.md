R code and anonymized data associated with the publication S. B. Bassing, D. E. Ausband, M. Mumma, S. Thompson, M. A. Hurley, and M. R. Falcy. Mammalian predator co-occurrence affected by prey and habitat more than competitor presence at multiple time scales. Ecological Monographs.

This repository archives the code used for analyses described in the manuscript. Camera trap locations and images are sensitive and cannot be provided publicly. Qualified researchers can contact Matt Boone ([idfgdatarequests\@idfg.idaho.gov](mailto:idfgdatarequests@idfg.idaho.gov){.email}), Data Management Lead, Idaho Department of Fish and Game, Idaho Fish and Wildlife Information System, 600 S Walnut, Boise, ID 83712 for full data requests. Query details: Camera trap data collected as part of the North Idaho Predator-Prey Project, collected from July 1 â€“ Sept. 15, 2020 and 2021 in Game Management Units (GMU) 1, 6, and 10A, including camera ID and location coordinates, camera setup style, camera deployment and retrieval dates, and detections of black bears, bobcats, coyotes, mountain lions, wolves, elk, moose, rabbit-hare, and white-tailed deer, including date, time, and trigger method of individual images.

**Script description:**

1.  Run_multispp_occupancy_models.R = runs multi-species occupancy models. Requires scripts stored in "Sourced_Scripts\_\_Multispecies_OccMod" folder, which format detection histories and covariate data (described below) and contains the JAGS code for each of the competing models.

2.  DIC_occupancy_model_selection.R = identifies top multi-species occupancy model for each species dyad using DIC

3.  Result_tables.R = creates final result tables for multi-species occupancy models and summary statistics for publication

4.  Figures_occupancy_prob_plots.R = creates figures for marginal and conditional occupancy probabilities

5.  Figures_detection_prob_plots.R = creates figures for marginal and conditional detection probabilities

6.  Wait_times.R = calculates time-between-detections and formats covariate data

7.  Run_exponential_models.R = runs generalized linear regression models using wait time data. Requires scripts stored in "Sourced_Scripts\_\_Wait_Times" folder, which contains the JAGS code for each of the competing models.

8.  DIC_exponential_model_selection.R = identifies top generalized linear regression model for each species using DIC

9.  Result_tables_and_figures_wait_times.R = creates result tables and figures for wait time analyses

**Data description:**

***Covariate data files:** Camera_Deployment_Data, Covariates_Smr20, Covariates_Smr21*

-   NewLocationID = unique identifier for each camera based on deployment location (GMU), camera setup (P vs U), and camera number

-   GMU = Idaho Department of Fish & Game Game Management Unit where sampling occurred (GMU 1, GMU 6, and GMU 10A)

-   Setup = camera setup style (ungulate = random location, 1.5 m high and perpendicular to ground; predator = on dirt-bottomed linear feature, \>2.5 m high and angled towards ground)

-   Season = Summer of data collection (Smr20 = summer 2020, Smr21 = summer 2021)

-   CameraHeight_M = height of camera from ground (m)

-   CameraFacing = general feature camera is view-shed focuses on (e.g., road, decommissioned road, hiking trail, game trail, random) perc_forest = percentage of forested habitat within 100m of a camera site

-   Elevation\_\_10m2 = elevation (m) derived from a Digital Elevation Model (10 m-sq pixel resolution)

-   TRI = Terrain Ruggedness Index representing terrain variability at camera site, derived from a Digital Elevation Model

-   elk_perday = number of independent detection events where elk were detected per day

-   lagomorphs_perday = number of independent detection events where lagomoprhs (hares and rabbits) were detected per day

-   moose_perday = number of independent detection events where moose were detected per day

-   whitetaileddeer_perday = number on independent detection events where white-tailed deer were detected per day

***Detection histories for occupancy models:** DetectionHist_Smr20 & DetectionHist_Smr21*

Contains the binary detection/non-detection data for each species at each camera site during each 7-day sampling occasion in summer, July 1 - September 15, 2020 and 2021

***Camera operation table for occupancy models:** Camera_Operable_Smr20 & Camera_Operable_Smr21*

Contains the dates of deployment and retrieval, as well as any dates when a camera was temporarily inoperable

***Sampling effort for occupancy models:** SamplingEffort_Smr20 & SamplingEffort_Smr21*

Contains the number of days each camera was operational during each 7-day sampling occasion in summer, July 1 - September 15, 2020 and 2021. Maximum number of days operational = 7. NA = camera was not operational for the entire 7-day sampling occasion.

***Detection data for wait time analyses:** dets_smr20, dets_smr21, prob_dets_smr20 & prob_dets_smr21*

Contains observations of species detected on camera, date and time of detection, and camera operation status (prob_dets datasets indicate images where the camera was "severely misdirected" or "completely obscured" and are removed)

-   NewLocationID = unique identifier for each camera based on deployment location (GMU), camera setup (P vs U), and camera number

-   Filename = unique identifier for each individual image

-   Date = date of image

-   Time = time of image

-   posix_date_time = combined date and time in POSIX format

-   OpState = camera operational state

-   Species = species of object detected in each image Count = number of individuals detected in each image

-   Category = classification indicating whether object detected was a predator or not
